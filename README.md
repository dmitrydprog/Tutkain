**Note**: You might want to check back later. I'm currently rewriting large parts of Tutkain. I will drop nREPL support and focus on socket REPL support instead.

**Tutkain** is a [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) package for writing [Clojure](https://www.clojure.org/).

For documentation, see [tutkain.flowthing.me](https://tutkain.flowthing.me).
